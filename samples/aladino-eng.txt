Once upon a time there was a boy named Aladdin who lived in the Far East with his mother, in a simple and humble house. They had just enough to live, so every day, Aladdin roamed the city center in search of some food to put in his mouth.

On one occasion, he was walking among the fruit stalls in the market, when he came across a very strange man who looked like a foreigner. Aladdin was surprised to hear that he called his name.

- You're Aladdin, the tailor's son, right?

 

- Yes, and it is true that my father was a tailor, but ... Who are you?

- I'm your uncle! You don't recognize me because I haven't been here for many years. I see that you are wearing very old clothes and I am sorry to see you so skinny. I imagine that in your house there is no money left over ...

Aladdin hung his head a little embarrassed. He looked like a beggar and his dark face was so bony that it made him look much older.
